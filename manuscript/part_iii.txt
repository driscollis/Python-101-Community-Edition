Part III - Intermediate Odds and Ends
=====================================

In Part III, you will learn about some Python internals that many would
consider intermediate-level Python. You have graduated from the milk and
you're ready for some meat! In this section, we will take a look at the
following topics:

> -   Debugging
> -   Decorators
> -   The lambda statement
> -   Profiling your code
> -   Testing

The first chapter in this section will introduce you to Python's
debugging module, **pdb** and how to use it to debug your code. The next
chapter is all about decorators. You will learn about how to create them
and about a few of the decorators that are built into Python. For the
third chapter, we will be looking at the lambda statement, which
basically creates a one-line anonymous function. It's a little weird,
but fun! The fourth chapter will cover how you profile your code. This
discipline gives you the ability to find possible bottlenecks in your
code so that you know where to focus to optimize your code. The final
chapter in this section is about testing your code. In it you will
discover how to test your code using a couple of Python's own built-in
modules.

I think you will find this section very helpful in continuing your
Python education. Let's jump right in!
