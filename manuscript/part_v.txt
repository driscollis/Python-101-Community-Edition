Part V - Packaging and Distribution
===================================

In Part V you will learn about Python packaging and the various methods
to distribute your code. You will learn about the following:

> -   How to create a module and package
> -   Publishing your Packages to the Python Packaging Index (PyPI)
> -   Python eggs
> -   Python wheels
> -   py2exe
> -   bb\_freeze
> -   cx\_Freeze
> -   PyInstaller
> -   GUI2Exe
> -   How to Create an Installer with InnoSetup

The first chapter of this section describes how to create a module or
package. Then in the following chapter, we will go over publishing our
package to PyPI. Next up, we will learn how to create and install a
Python egg and the Python wheel.

The next four chapters will cover how to create binaries using the
following 3rd party packages: py2exe, bb\_freeze, cx\_Freeze and
PyInstaller. The only package in this list that is actually compatible
with Python 3 is cx\_Freeze. Because of this fact, we will be showing
Python 2 examples in these four chapters so that we can easily compare
all 4 packages and their capabilities.

The next to last chapter will show you how to use GUI2Exe, a neat little
user interface that was created to go on top of py2exe, bb\_freeze, etc.
GUI2Exe makes creating binaries even easier!

The last chapter of this section will show how to create an installer
using InnoSetup. Let's get started!
