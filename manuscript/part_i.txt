Part I - Learning the Basics
============================

In Part I, we will learn the basics of the Python programming language.
This section of the book should get you ready to use all the building
blocks of Python so that you will be ready to tackle the following
sections confidently.

Let's go over what we'll be covering:

> -   IDLE
> -   Strings
> -   Lists, Dictionaries and Tuples
> -   Conditional statements
> -   Loops
> -   Comprehensions
> -   Exception Handling
> -   File I/O
> -   Importing modules and packages
> -   Functions
> -   Classes

The first chapter in this section will familiarize you with Python's
built-in development environment that is known as IDLE. The next couple
of chapters will go over some of Python's types, such as strings, lists,
and dictionaries. After that we'll look at conditional statements in
Python and looping using Python's **for** and **while** loops.

In the second half of this section, we will go into comprehensions, such
as list and dictionary comprehensions. Then we'll look at Python's
exception handling capabilities and how Python's file operations work.
Next up is learning how to import pre-made modules and packages. The
last two chapters cover Python functions and classes.

Let's get started!
