Part II - Learning from the Library
===================================

In Part II, you will get an abbreviated tour of some of the Python
Standard Library. The reason it's abbreviated is that the Python
Standard Library is HUGE! So this section is to get you acquainted with
using the modules that come with Python. I will be going over the
modules I use the most in my day-to-day job and the modules I've seen
used by my co-workers. I think this mini-tour will prepare you for
digging in on your own.

Let's take a look at what we'll be covering:

> -   Introspection
> -   csv
> -   ConfigParser
> -   logging
> -   os
> -   smtplib / email
> -   subprocess
> -   sys
> -   thread / queues
> -   time / datetime

The first chapter in this section will give you a quick tutorial into
Python's **introspection** abilities; basically you'll learn how to make
Python tell you about itself, which sounds kind of weird but is really
quite valuable to know about. Next we'll learn how to use
**ConfigParser**, a neat little module that let's you read and write
config files. After that we'll take a look at **logging**. The **os**
module can do lots of fun things, but we'll try to focus on the ones
that I think you'll find most useful. The **subprocess** allows you to
open other processes.

You will find the **sys** module allows you to exit a program, get the
Python path, acquire version information, redirect stdout and a whole
lot more. The thread module allows you to create **threads** in your
program. We won't dive too deep into that subject as it can get
confusing pretty quickly. The **time** and **datetime** modules allow
you to manipulate dates and time in Python, which has many applications
when it comes to developing programs.

Let's get started!
